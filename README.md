A Moodle Architecture Calculator
Concept and Data by Noveck Gowandan
Initial web build by Ameer Karim


Written in php as it was part of my old website that is no longer hosted.


TO DO:

Modify the php to js to allow it to run on github pages.
The architecture calculations may need updating since it was intended to be a rough starting point to help estimate needs rather than be a definitive solution.
